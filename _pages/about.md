I am a PhD student in Machine Learning in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/). My long term research goal is to create theoretically grounded methods for creating intelligent agents which scale to large real-life scenarios.

My research has been generously supported by [J.P. Morgan A.I. Fellowship](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology/artificial-intelligence/awards/phd-fellowship-award-recipients-2020), [Google-DeepMind Scholarship](https://deepmind.com/scholarships) and [Draper's Fellowship](https://thedrapers.co.uk/fellowship/). I have also been fortunate to spend time at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com), [J.P. Morgan A.I.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) and [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).
