I am a PhD student in Machine Learning in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/). My long term research goal is to create theoretically grounded methods for intelligent agents which scale to large, real-life scenarios.

My research has been generously supported by [J.P. Morgan A.I. Fellowship](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology/artificial-intelligence/awards/phd-fellowship-award-recipients-2020), [Google-DeepMind Scholarship](https://deepmind.com/scholarships) and [Draper's Scholarship](https://thedrapers.co.uk/fellowship/). Previously, I have also spent time at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com), [J.P. Morgan A.I.](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) and [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/).

Interests
======
My research is focused onfinding theoretically grounded methods for problems in single and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) which perform well on large, challenging domains.

I am interested in using ideas from learning theory, information theory and optimisation in my work to provide guarantees for important properties like generalization, performance, convergence & robustness, and formulate a principled framework for analysing the effects of assumptions made on the hypothesis class for candidate solutions. I am also interested in using these methods for equipping agents with attributes that help capture aspects like symmetry, compositionality and reasoning.


Research Opportunities
======
I am happy to discuss and collaborate on topics related to my research interests. If you are interested, please send me an email. I especially encourage students from under-represented groups and motivated graduate students to reach out.
